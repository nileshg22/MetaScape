# MetaScape
Making traveling a community
  * Our program allows users to create their trip itineraries and have other people edit them

## USAGE
  * When traveling to a different state or even country, people can recieve feedback on what places to visit, which hotel to stay in, or where to rent a car from. 
  
## BUILD Process
  * PHP
    * We Used PHP for most of the back end. PHP was used to display the databases we created on postgreSQL.
  * PostgreSQL
    * PostgreSQL was used to manage databases and tables. Using these we are able to take input as well as display.
  * HTML CSS
    * HTML and CSS was used to make all of the front end. 
  * Flask
    * Flask was used in order to allow users to interact with the databases and use the "Create" part of our website. 

## BUILD/INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
    * You will first need to install a variety of softwares include postgreSQL, Flask, and SQLAlchemy
    * Create the databases inside of the shell provided by postgreSQL
